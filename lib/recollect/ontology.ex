defmodule Recollect.Ontology do
  @moduledoc """
  Ontology-lite: a small canonical vocabulary for entity types and relation
  types, plus synonym mapping, so the knowledge graph converges on shared
  terms instead of accumulating near-duplicates ("server" vs "machine" vs
  "host").

  Canonical types are the default vocabulary; anything else is kept as a
  custom type (flagged `custom_type: true` in properties at persist time)
  rather than rejected.

  ## Extension

  Host apps extend the vocabulary via application env:

      config :recollect, :ontology,
        entity_types: ["workspace"],
        relations: ["reviews"],
        entity_synonyms: %{"ws" => "workspace"},
        relation_synonyms: %{"reviews_code" => "reviews"}
